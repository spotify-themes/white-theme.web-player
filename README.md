(Todo: better instructions)

While I can't write better instrucions due to lack of time, please bear with me with the oversimplified version.

Tl;Dr:

Use the Spotify Web player and the Chrome extension "Stylus" to add custom styling to any web page. Add the styles from `theme.css` to `open.spotify.com`.
